/**
 * A Cuckoo filter for instances of {@code T}. Cuckoo filters are probabilistic
 * hash tables similar to Bloom filters but with several advantages. Like Bloom
 * filters, a Cuckoo filter can determine if an object is contained within a set
 * at a specified false positive rate with no false negatives. Like Bloom, a
 * Cuckoo filter can determine if an element is probably inserted or definitely
 * is not. In addition, and unlike standard Bloom filters, Cuckoo filters allow
 * deletions and counting. They also use less space than a Bloom filter for
 * similar performance.
 *
 * <p>
 * The false positive rate of the filter is the probability that
 * {@linkplain #mightContain(Object)}} will erroneously return {@code true} for
 * an object that was not added to the filter. Unlike Bloom filters, a Cuckoo
 * filter will fail to insert when it reaches capacity. If an insert fails
 * {@linkplain #put(Object)} will {@code return false} .
 * 
 * <p>
 * Cuckoo filters allow deletion like counting Bloom filters using
 * {@code #delete(Object)}. While counting Bloom filters invariably use more
 * space to allow deletions, Cuckoo filters achieve this with <i>no</i> space or
 * time cost. Like counting variations of Bloom filters, Cuckoo filters have a
 * limit to the number of times you can insert duplicate items. This limit is
 * 8-9 in the current design, depending on internal state. You should never
 * exceed 7 if possible. <i>Reaching this limit can cause further inserts to
 * fail and degrades the performance of the filter</i>. Occasional duplicates
 * will not degrade the performance of the filter but will slightly reduce
 * capacity.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This Cuckoo filter implementation also allows counting the number of inserts
 * for each item using {@code #approximateCount(Object)}. This is probabilistic
 * like the rest of the filter and any error is always an increase. The count
 * will never return less than the number of actual inserts, but may return
 * more. The insert limit of 7 still stands when counting so this is only useful
 * for small numbers.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Once the filter reaches capacity ({@linkplain #put(Object)} returns false).
 * It's best to either rebuild the existing filter or create a larger one.
 * Deleting items in the current filter is also an option, but you should delete
 * at least ~2% of the items in the filter before inserting again.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Existing items can be deleted without affecting the false positive rate or
 * causing false negatives. However, deleting items that were <i>not</i>
 * previously added to the filter can cause false negatives.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Hash collision attacks are theoretically possible against Cuckoo filters (as
 * with any hash table based structure). If this is an issue for your
 * application, use one of the cryptographically secure (but slower) hash
 * functions. The default hash function, Murmer3 is <i>not</i> secure. Secure
 * functions include SHA and SipHash. All hashes, including non-secure, are
 * internally seeded and salted. Practical attacks against any of them are
 * unlikely.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This implementation of a Cuckoo filter is serializable.
