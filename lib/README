*Introduction

Jpcap is a Java class package that allows Java applications to 
capture and/or send packets to the network.

Jpcap is based on libpcap/winpcap and Raw Socket API. 
Therefore, Jpcap is supposed to work on any OS on which 
libpcap/winpcap has been implemented. 
Currently, Jpcap has been tested on FreeBSD 3.x, 
Linux RedHat 6.1, Fedora Core 4, Solaris, and Microsoft 
Windows 2000/XP.

Jpcap supports the following types of packets: 
Ethernet, IPv4, IPv6, ARP/RARP, TCP, UDP, and ICMPv4.  
Other types of packets are captured as raw packets 
(i.e., instances of the Packet class) which contains 
the whole data of the packets.  This allows Java applications 
to analyze unsupported packet types.


*Requirements:

  - Java 2 Runtime Environment or Development Kit (http://java.sun.com)
  - libpcap ver.0.9.4 or higher (http://www.tcpdump.org)
    OR
  - WinPcap ver.3.1 or higher (http://winpcap.polito.it/)

* Compile

On UNIX:
# I'm sorry but I have to say that I'm not an expert UNIX C programmer,
# so I cannot make a good Makefile...

Go to "src/c". Then, edit Makefile.
There are several options you have to change
according to the type of the OS you're installing to.

Also you might have to modify Jpcap_sub.h to enable IPv6 feature.
However, you need header files for v6 installed in your OS.

Run make to generate libjpcap.so.
(If you get an error "structure has no member name sa_len...",
please comment out the line "#define HAVE_SA_LEN" in Jpcap_sub.h.
I'm so sorry for inconvenience.)


On Windows:
I included the project file of Visual C++, yet I'm not sure
if it works under different environment. It is under "src/c/Proj".
You can open the project file, and compile the source files to generate
Jpcap.dll.


*Installation

On UNIX:
1) Copy libjpcap.so to [Java directory]/jre/lib/<arch>.
   <arch> is either "i386" or "sparc" 
OR
1') Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the path where libjpcap.so exists.

2) Copy jpcap.jar to extension directory (eg./usr/local/java/jre/lib/ext)
OR
2') Set CLASSPATH to include jpcap.jar.

On Windows:

Download and run the self installer.

OR

1) Copy "lib\Jpcap.dll" into "[JRE directory]\bin" or
   "[JRE directory]\lib\ext\x86"
2) Copy "lib\jpcap.jar" into "[JRE directory]\lib\ext"
3) If you installed JDK, you also need to copy "lib\jpcap.jar" into
"[JDK directory]\jre\lib\ext". 

Note: [JRE directory] is usually "C:\Program Files\Java\j2re*".
      [JDK directory] is usually "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk*".


*Usage
